Everyone in the team is important!

Quality Assurance (QA) is the process of ensuring that products or systems meet specified quality standards.
In software, QA involves activities like planning, test design, and defect tracking to make sure the product is reliable,
performs as expected, and meets user requirements.
QA includes both manual and automated testing, aiming to prevent defects,
improve processes, and deliver consistent, high-quality results.
